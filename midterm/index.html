            <div class="our-story">
                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Top Dog grew out of a boy's love of sausage, a staple in his German immigrants' New York home over the WWII years. Steaks? Tubesteaks! His paper route to a well-mixed neighborhood assured that Italian, Polish, even Hungarian sausages were soon no strangers to that developing appetite and palate. Nor had he far to go to a cart offering kosher style "Franks", usually better off the griddle.</p>

                <h2>Our Delicious Eats</h2>
                <p>Based out of Berkeley, top dog caters around the Bay Area serving up that nostaglic reminder of when food not only tasted great, but was fun. From small, intimate backyard parties, to large functions with thousands of attendees, we can do it all. We can help you choose a menu of up to 4 delicious types of hot dogs with tasty sides and ice cold drinks to suit. To allow for those that are super hungry and just love our hot dogs (believe me, there is MORE than one in every crowd..!) we always bring extra.</p>
