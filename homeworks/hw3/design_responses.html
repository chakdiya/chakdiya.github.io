					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that picking a font relies so much on its use case: target users, color palette, product strategy, etc. For example, even though sans serif fonts like Arial are usually easy to read, there are probably better options when designing for, let's say a children's game. The main thing that I'll remember is that fonts should always be readable, legible, and purposeful.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I loved how the article provided so many resources for working with type. For the rest of this class, I'll practice using the WhatTheFont chrome extension and some of the other websites. I hope to improve in identifying good font pairings and ratios for type sizes.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
