					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that you can't only rely on color contrast to make your designs accessible. For example, Trello has a color-blind mode that incorporates patterns so that users with vision impairments can still distinguish between different elements. I also appreciate how there were many hyperlinked resources I could save for later -- I can reference these when I'm working on my midterm and final projects!
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how there were many examples of accessible and not accessible design. While accessible design should be universal, it's very deliberate and difficult to make a design accessible by accident. I also liked how the article ended with clear next steps. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> â€œNot creating accessible products is just rude, so don't be rude." Justin Reyna </p>
