        <!--Add a paragraph about yourself. (Hint: "Text" slide)-->
        <p>Hi! I'm a junior studying CogSci with a data science minor from Irvine, California. I'm really interested in design and 
            increasing access to opportunity through education. Post grad, I hope to be a product designer in tech. In my free time, 
            I love to cook restaurant recipes at home, explore Berkeley on my electric scooter, and chase sunsets.</p>

        <!--Create a bulleted list of your three favorite places to eat in Berkeley. (Hint: "Lists" slide)-->
        <ul>
            <li>Toss Noodle Bar</li>
            <li>Kimchi Garden</li>
            <li>Crave Subs</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Add a picture of yourself so we can recognize you in class! (Hint: "Images" slide)-->
        <img src="img/diya.jpg" />

        <!--Add a link that, when clicked, directs you to the your favorite website. 
            The text within the link should be the name of the website. (Hint: "Links" slide)-->
        <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>


        <!--PART 2-->

        <ul>
        <!--Please answer the following questions and add your responses to your index.html using a list (Hint: 'ul' tag).-->

        <!--What is something you learned from this article? (2-3 sentences)-->
            <li>I learned how important content is, and how tailored it should be for the interface and what you want your user to do. 
                For example, it's interesting how instead of "search here," the Airbnb interface encourages us to try a specific city.</li>   

        <!--What was your favorite part of this article? (2-3 sentences)-->
            <li>My favorite part is seeing screenshots of apps I use, and how the author breaks down design decisions that were made.
                As a designer myself, it's always interesting to see what other people point out things I didn't originally notice.</li>

        <!--Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool.-->
            <li>"Know the rules, so you can break em"</li>

        <!--On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below 5, please briefly explain why.-->
            <li>9</li>
